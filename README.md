# Fantastic Full Source Code

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `npm i` inside it as administrator.

## Getting started

If you just want to run the server, navigate to the `server` directory and use the `npm start`.

The client has 2 different directories: `front/main_interface` and `front/node_viewer`, the Node Viewer being the tab which breaks out from the main interface when you want to inspect a single host. These are already built and can be found in the `server/src` directory, however if you wish to build them again, navigate to the appropriate directory and run `npm run js` which will rebuild any changes as you make them.
