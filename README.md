# Fantastic Full Source Code

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `npm i` inside it.

## Getting started

If you just want to run the server, navigate to the `server` directory and use the `npm start`.

To build the client, navigate to the `front` directory and use `npm run js`. This will launch webpack in watch mode and any changes you make to the client code will automatically be built to `main.js` in the server directory.

See the `server/documentation` directory for the user documentation.
